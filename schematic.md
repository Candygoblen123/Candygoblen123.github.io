# Using a schematic to preview a build in MC

First, you'll need to install the [Fabric Modloader](https://fabricmc.net/). It installs like Minecraft forge, just download the .jar file and open it.

If you want to use Optifine, you'll need to put Optifine *and* OptiFabric in the `.minecraft/mods/` folder. 
You can download [OptiFabric here](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/optifabric).

You'll need the [LiteMatica mod](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/litematica) to view the schematic. Put the .jar file in the `.minecraft/mods/` folder. 
Then put the schematic (a .nbt file) in the `.minecraft/schematics` folder. (If you don't see that folder, launch minecraft with the mod installed first.)

Once in game, Press `M` to open the LiteMatica menu. To load a schmatic from a file, click on Loaded Schematics => Load Schematic. The schmatic will now be placed where you are standing.
