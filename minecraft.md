# Join the LiveTL minecraft server with a bedrock client!

0. Note that console versions, cannot join non-offical servers. There is a [workaround](https://github.com/Pugmatt/BedrockConnect#hosting-your-own-serverlist-server) if you have some technical knowledge though.
1. Get a mojang (or microsoft) account that has a legitimate version of Minecraft Java. No, it cannot be a pirated version. Sorry about that. 
2. Launch minecraft, and click (or tap) on play, and navigate over to the servers tab. 
3. Scroll to the bottom of the server list, and click on "Add Server" (if this button does not appear, your minecraft client does not support non-offical servers. Sorry about that)
4. Enter a server name.  It can be whatever you want.
5. Enter our server address: ggrks.moe
6. Leave the port as 19132.  If the port is not 19132, change it to 19132.
7. Click on "Save"
8. Click on the server that we just added, then click on "Join Server"
9. You will be asked to login.  First, choose wether you want to log in with a mojang or microsoft account. If you don't know, choose mojang. 
10. If you chose microsoft, you will be asked if you want to log in with a web browser or with a username and password. you can choose whatever you want, but keep in mind that web browser requires another device.
11. Log in with your account that has a legitmate version of Minecraft Java.
12. You should be dropped into the world. Have fun!

### Other notes

- We use 1.16 combat across platforms, so be prepared to start having a cooldown while in combat. 
- Your save data will sync across platform, meaning that you can play on the java edition, and then pick up where you left off on bedrock. 
- You can use your offhand! To switch an item to your offhand on bedrock, simply use any emote. (because of this emotes will not play, even on other bedrock clients)
- Redstone will be based off of java, so bedrock based redstone will not work.  Java based redstone will work across platform, since redstone logic is handeled server side.
